# Program Correctness
Program specification
  correctness    
Loop invariant   
use for program correctness analyse
  developing code

## Program VS specification
### spec: what program does
 - input: types + preconditions
 - output
 - side effects
eg:
Powering: 
  input: a (Z), b (Z+)
  output: a^b 
eg: 
Greatest Common Divsor
  input: a,b (Z+)
  output: GCD(a,b)
eg:
Merging sorted arrays
  input: A(1..n)array of ints, sorted; B(1....m) array of ints, sorted
  output: sorted concatenation C(1...m+n)
#### Program Correctness
it means program satisfies its spec
sometimes split into 
 1) soundness: on every valid input, if the program terminates, then its output is correct. 
 2) termination: on every valid input, the program terminates. 

##### EXAMPLE: Powering
```
procedure It-Power(a,b)
    r<-a
    c<-1
    while c <b do
        r <-r*a
        c <- c + 1
    return r
```
soundness: if and when loop ends, r = a^b
Loop invariant:
  statement that holds each time the loop test is executed. 
claim: r = a^c is a loop invariant
for every t (Z+) P(t)
  where P(t): if and when test is executed for the .. time r = a^c
PF: base case: t = 1 P(1) n = a c = 1
   induction step for every t (Z+) P(1) P(1) => P(t+1)
   I.H: rt=a^ct
   rt+1=r^t * a
