# eg
there are n boys and n girls    
each girl has her own ranked preference

# algorithm
for each day that some boy gets a no do:
 - morning 
    each girl stands on her balcony
    each boy proposes under the balcony of the best girl whom he has not yet crossed off
 - afternoon for those girls with at least one suitor
    to day's best suitor: maybe come back tomorrow
    to any others: no i'll never marry you
 - evening any rejected boy crosses the girl off his list

each girl marries the boy to whom she last said "maybe"


improvement lemma: if a girl has a boy on a string, then she will always have someone at lest as good  on a string (or for a husband)

she would only let go of him in order to "maybe" someone better.....(Proof by induction)

Lemma: no boy can be rejected by all the firls

```
proof by contradiction:
suppose boy b is rejected by all the girls
    at that point: each girl must have a suitor other than b. (by improvement lemma once a girl has a suitor she will always have at least one)
    then n girls have n suitors, b not among them. Thus there are at least n+1 boys --> CONTRADICTION

```

Thorem: The TMA always terminates in at most n^2 days.
 - A "master list" of all n of the boys lists starts with a total of n^2 girls on it
 - each day that at least one boy gets a "No", at least one girl gets crossed off the master list
 - therefore, the number of days is bounded by the original size of the master list. IN fact, sinnce, each list never  drops below 1, the number of days is bounded by n(n-1) <= n^2 

corollary: each girl will marry her absolute favorite of the boys who visit her during the TMA. 

the TMA will terminate and produce a pairing. 
 - is it stable?

Theorem: Let T be the pairing produced by TMA. T is stable. 

A boy's optimal girl is the highest ranked girl for whom ther is some stable pairing in which the boy gets her. She is the worst girl he can conceivably get in a stable world.

The traditional marriage algorithm always produces a male-optimal, female-pessimal pairing
